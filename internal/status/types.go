// Package status provides functionality for reading and writing sprint status YAML files.
//
// The sprint-status.yaml file tracks the development status of stories throughout
// their lifecycle. Each story progresses through statuses: backlog -> ready-for-dev ->
// in-progress -> review -> done.
//
// Key types:
//   - [Status] - Story development status enum with validation
//   - [SprintStatus] - Parsed representation of sprint-status.yaml
//   - [Reader] - Reads and queries sprint status from YAML files
//   - [Writer] - Updates status values while preserving YAML formatting
//
// The package uses yaml.v3's Node API for writes to preserve comments, ordering,
// and formatting in the status file.
package status

// Status represents a story's development status in the workflow lifecycle.
//
// A story progresses through statuses as it moves through development:
// backlog -> ready-for-dev -> in-progress -> review -> done.
//
// The status determines which workflow command is executed when running a story.
// See the internal/router package for status-to-workflow mapping.
