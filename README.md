# bmad-automate

A CLI tool for automating [BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) development workflows with Claude AI.

## Overview

`bmad-automate` orchestrates Claude to run [BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) development workflows including story creation, implementation, code review, and git operations. It's designed to automate repetitive development tasks by delegating them to Claude with predefined prompts.

## Features

- **Workflow Automation** - Run predefined workflows (create-story, dev-story, code-review, git-commit)
- **Status-Based Routing** - Automatically determines next workflow based on story status
- **Full Lifecycle Execution** - Run a story from current status to completion with a single command
- **Epic Processing** - Process all stories in an epic in order
- **Queue Processing** - Process multiple stories in batch
- **Dry Run Mode** - Preview workflows without executing them
- **Configurable Prompts** - Customize workflow prompts via YAML configuration
- **Streaming Output** - Real-time feedback from Claude's execution
- **Styled Terminal Output** - Clean, readable output with progress indicators

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- [Claude CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed and configured
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) (optional, for running tasks)

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bmad-automate.git
cd bmad-automate
go install ./cmd/bmad-automate
```

Or using just:

```bash
just install
```

### Build Only

```bash
just build
# Binary will be created as ./bmad-automate
```

## Usage

### Single Workflow Commands

```bash
# Create a story definition
bmad-automate create-story <story-key> # eg 1-5

# Implement a story
bmad-automate dev-story <story-key>

# Run code review
bmad-automate code-review <story-key>

# Commit and push changes
bmad-automate git-commit <story-key>
```

### Full Lifecycle

Run a story from its current status to completion:

```bash
bmad-automate run <story-key>
```

This executes all remaining workflows based on the story's current status:

- `backlog` → create-story → dev-story → code-review → git-commit → done
- `ready-for-dev` → dev-story → code-review → git-commit → done
- `in-progress` → dev-story → code-review → git-commit → done
- `review` → code-review → git-commit → done
- `done` → skipped (story already complete)

Status is automatically updated in `sprint-status.yaml` after each successful workflow.

Preview what workflows would run without executing them:

```bash
bmad-automate run <story-key> --dry-run
```

### Epic Processing

Run the full lifecycle for all stories in an epic:

```bash
bmad-automate epic <epic-id>
```

This finds all stories matching the pattern `{epic-id}-{N}-*` (where N is numeric), sorts them by story number, and runs each to completion before moving to the next.

Example:

```bash
bmad-automate epic 6
# Runs 6-1-*, 6-2-*, 6-3-*, etc. each to completion in order
```

The epic command stops on the first failure. Done stories are skipped.

#### Dry Run

Preview what workflows would run without executing them:

```bash
bmad-automate epic 6 --dry-run
```

### Queue Processing

Run the full lifecycle for multiple stories in batch:

```bash
bmad-automate queue <story-key> [story-key...]
```

Each story is run to completion before moving to the next. The queue stops on the first failure. Done stories are skipped.

Example:

```bash
bmad-automate queue 6-5 6-6 6-7 6-8
```

Preview what workflows would run without executing them:

```bash
bmad-automate queue 6-5 6-6 6-7 --dry-run
```

### Raw Prompts

Run an arbitrary prompt:

```bash
bmad-automate raw "List all Go files in the project"
```

### Help

```bash
bmad-automate --help
bmad-automate <command> --help
```

## Configuration

### Config File

Create a `config/workflows.yaml` file to customize workflow prompts:

```yaml
workflows:
  create-story:
    prompt_template: "Your custom prompt for {{.StoryKey}}"

  dev-story:
    prompt_template: "Your dev prompt for {{.StoryKey}}"

  code-review:
    prompt_template: "Your review prompt for {{.StoryKey}}"

  git-commit:
    prompt_template: "Your commit prompt for {{.StoryKey}}"

full_cycle:
  steps:
    - create-story
    - dev-story
    - code-review
    - git-commit

claude:
  output_format: stream-json
  binary_path: claude

output:
  truncate_lines: 20
  truncate_length: 60
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable           | Description                | Default                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `BMAD_CONFIG_PATH` | Path to custom config file | `./config/workflows.yaml` |
| `BMAD_CLAUDE_PATH` | Path to Claude binary      | `claude`                  |

### Sprint Status File

The `run`, `queue`, and `epic` commands read and update story status from:

```
_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml
```

Example format:

```yaml
development_status:
  6-1-setup-project: done
  6-2-add-feature: in-progress
  6-3-fix-bug: backlog
```

Valid status values:

| Status          | Description                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `backlog`       | Story not yet started             |
| `ready-for-dev` | Story ready for implementation    |
| `in-progress`   | Story currently being implemented |
| `review`        | Story in code review              |
| `done`          | Story complete                    |
